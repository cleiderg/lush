# shared/map

Central-campus map (Aldrich Park and the ring around it), generated from OpenStreetMap. Data © OpenStreetMap contributors (ODbL).

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `source/osm-central.json` | Committed OSM snapshot (`node shared/map/fetch.mjs` refreshes it; needs network) |
| `build.mjs` | `node shared/map/build.mjs [outDir]` writes `campus.json` and `collision.bin`. Offline and deterministic |
| `campus.json` | Compact map for rendering |
| `collision.bin` | Collision grid for client and server |
| `config.mjs` | Bounding box, origin, chunk size, cell size |

## Coordinates

Metres from the origin (centre of the bounding box): **x = east, z = south**, y up. Files store integer **decimetres** (1 unit = 0.1 m).

## Chunks

The world is split into square chunks of **64 m** (`chunkSize`). Chunk `(cx, cz) = (floor((x - minX) / 64), floor((z - minZ) / 64))` where `minX`, `minZ` are `bounds` in metres. Bounds are whole multiples of the chunk size.

## `campus.json`

`{version, attribution, units, origin{lat,lon}, chunkSize, bounds{minX,minZ,maxX,maxZ}, buildings, paths, green}`

- `buildings[]`: `{id, h, p}`. `h` height, `p` closed footprint `[x0,z0,x1,z1,...]` (last point not repeated).
- `paths[]`: `{id, w, p}`. `w` width, `p` open polyline.
- `green[]`: `{id, k, p}`. `k`: 0 grass, 1 wood, 2 water, 3 pitch; `p` closed polygon.

## `collision.bin`

Little-endian. 22-byte header, then bits.

| Offset | Type | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 4 bytes | magic `LCOL` |
| 4 | u8 | version (1) |
| 5 | u8 | flags (0) |
| 6 | u16 | cell size in decimetres (10 = 1 m) |
| 8 | u16 | chunk size in cells (64) |
| 10 | u16 | width in cells (x direction) |
| 12 | u16 | height in cells (z direction) |
| 14 | i32 | origin x (west edge) in decimetres |
| 18 | i32 | origin z (north edge) in decimetres |
| 22 | bytes | `ceil(width*height/8)` bytes, row-major (`index = row*width + col`, row = z, col = x), LSB-first; bit 1 = blocked |

Cell `(col,row)` covers x in `[originX + col*cell, +cell)`, z likewise. A cell is blocked when its centre is inside a building or water. Cells outside the file are blocked.

Go reading sketch: `blocked := data[22+idx>>3]>>(idx&7)&1 == 1`.
